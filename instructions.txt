this is how you should build a successful algorithm:
	[1] understand the problem well.
	[2] think about a primitive solution.
	[3] ask what makes this solution work.
	[4] ask what makes this solution bad.
	[5] see how to make this solution better.
	[6] implement a proof of concept.
	[7] evaluate and enhance.
